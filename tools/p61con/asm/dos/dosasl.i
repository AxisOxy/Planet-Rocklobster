************************ PATTERN MATCHING ******************************
************************************************************************

* structure expected by MatchFirst, MatchNext.
* Allocate this structure and initialize it as follows:
*
* Set ap_BreakBits to the signal bits (CDEF) that you want to take a
* break on, or NULL, if you don't want to convenience the user.
*
* If you want to have the FULL PATH NAME of the files you found,
* allocate a buffer at the END of this structure, and put the size of
* it into ap_Strlen.  If you don't want the full path name, make sure
* you set ap_Strlen to zero.  In this case, the name of the file, and stats
* are available in the ap_Info, as per usual.
*
* Then call MatchFirst() and then afterwards, MatchNext() with this structure.
* You should check the return value each time (see below) and take the
* appropriate action, ultimately calling MatchEnd() when there are
* no more files and you are done.  You can tell when you are done by
* checking for the normal AmigaDOS return code ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES.
