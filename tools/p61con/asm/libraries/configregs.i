**
** AutoConfig (tm) boards each contain a 32 byte "ExpansionRom" area that is
** read by the system software at configuration time.  Configuration of each
** board starts when the ConfigIn* signal is passed from the previous board
** (or from the system for the first board).  Each board will present it's
** ExpansionRom structure at location $00E80000 to be read by the system.
** This file defines the appearance of the ExpansionRom area.
**
** Expansion boards are actually organized such that only one nybble per
** 16 bit word contains valid information.  The low nybbles of each
** word are combined to fill the structure below. (This table is structured
** as LOGICAL information.  This means that it never corresponds exactly
** with a physical implementation.)
**
** The ExpansionRom space is further split into two regions:  The first 16
** bytes are read-only.  Except for the er_type field, this area is inverted
** by the system software when read in.  The second 16 bytes contain the
** control portion, where all read/write registers are located.
**
** The system builds one "ConfigDev" structure for each board found.  The
** list of boards can be examined using the expansion.library/FindConfigDev
** function.
**
** A special "hacker" Manufacturer ID number is reserved for test use:
** 2011 ($7DB).  When inverted this will look like $F824.

**
** Note that use of the ec_BaseAddress register is tricky.  The system
** will actually write twice.  First the low order nybble is written
** to the ec_BaseAddress register+2 (D15-D12).  Then the entire byte is
** written to ec_BaseAddress (D15-D8).  This allows writing of a byte-wide
** address to nybble size registers.

** many of the constants below consist of a triplet of equivalent
** definitions: xxMASK is a bit mask of those bits that matter.
** xxBIT is the starting bit number of the field.  xxSIZE is the
** number of bits that make up the definition.	This method is
** used when the field is larger than one bit.
**
** If the field is only one bit wide then the xxB_xx and xxF_xx convention
** is used (xxB_xx is the bit number, and xxF_xx is mask of the bit).

**
** these are the specifications for the diagnostic area.  If the Diagnostic
** Address Valid bit is set in the Board Type byte (the first byte in
** expansion space) then the Diag Init vector contains a valid offset.
**
** The Diag Init vector is actually a word offset from the base of the
** board.  The resulting address points to the base of the DiagArea
** structure.  The structure may be physically implemented either four,
** eight, or sixteen bits wide.  The code will be copied out into
** ram first before being called.
**
** The da_Size field, and both code offsets (da_DiagPoint and da_BootPoint)
** are offsets from the diag area AFTER it has been copied into ram, and
** "de-nybbleized" (if needed). (In other words, the byte size is the size of
** the actual information, not how much address space is required to
** store it.)
**
** All bits are encoded with uninverted logic (e.g. 5 volts on the bus
** is a logic one).
**
** If your board is to make use of the boot facility then it must leave
** its config area available even after it has been configured.  Your
** boot vector will be called AFTER your board's final address has been
** set.
