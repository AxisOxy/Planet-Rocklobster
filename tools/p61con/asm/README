The Player 6.1A converter source code (610.2)

I honestly thought I had released these sources ages ago already, but it
seems I didn't. Thanks to Robert Leffmann for bringing this to my
attention :) So here it is, hopefully still in compilable form.

Anyway, in case this is still useful to someone, I place it under
public domain, so feel free to use it as you wish.

Changes/Hacks by Axis/Oxyron to make this usable in an automated build process:

- Added missing dependencies.
- Fixed some issues to make this assembling with VASM.
- Removed user interface code with "ifd USER_INTERFACE" to make cmdline interface working without crashes.
- Added hacked command line code with hardcoded filenames (Commandline data is only used for detection).
- Added signaling of finished state with writing a finished file to the hd. So the build-process can detect that the conversion is done.

TODO:

- Make a real command line interface.
- Add signaling of error state. So the build-process can detect that the conversion failed.
