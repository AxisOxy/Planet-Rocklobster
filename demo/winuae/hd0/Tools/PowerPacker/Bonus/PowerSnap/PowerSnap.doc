     Snap, snap, snap, snap, eggs and snap :-)  Ahem...

     PowerSnap is a utility that allows you to use the mouse to mark
characters anywhere on the screen and paste them somewhere else, like in the
CLI or in a string gadget.  PowerSnap will check what font is used in the
window you snap from and will look for the position of the characters
automatically.  It recognizes all non proportional fonts of up to 24 pixels
wide and of any height so this should cover most fonts used.  Snapping and
pasting text is done using the mouse, making PowerSnap fast and easy to use.
     To try PowerSnap out, double-click its icon to install the handler, move
the mouse over a character on the screen, press the left ALT key and while
keeping this pressed press the left mouse button.  After a short delay
(depends on how big the font is) PowerSnap will either flash the screen,
indicating it hasn't found a character at this position (it is possible
PowerSnap didn't look for the correct font), or the character you are pointing
at will be selected.  Move the mouse while keeping the left ALT key and the
mouse button down to select more characters.  Once you are satisfied with what
you have selected release the left ALT key.  You can now insert the text you
have just snapped by pressing either left ALT + V or left ALT + right mouse
button.
     Both the left ALT and the 'V' keys mentioned in this short explanation
are user-definable (see below).  Also, don't start snapping on a space because
PowerSnap will almost certainly get the character positions wrong.  You CAN
start snapping on a space if you have already snapped in the window.


›1m2. Installation›0m
›1m===============›0m

     To install PowerSnap automatically run the installation script.  Install
manually by copying 'PowerSnap' and 'PowerSnap.info' to your C: directory and
'powersnap-handler' to your L: directory.  'powersnap-handler' does not have
to be in L: but it is best if you put it there, PowerSnap will also find it
if it is in the current directory.
     If you want PowerSnap to be part of your initial startup (so you always
have the comfort of snapping anything anywhere :-) you should put a simple
line saying 'PowerSnap' before the 'EndCLI >NIL:' in your startup-sequence.
If you wish to specify options include these on the same line, like e.g.
'PowerSnap COLOR 2'.  To disable the copyright message redirect output to NIL:
like in 'PowerSnap >NIL:'.
     Workbench 2.0 users have the following extra possibility:  drag the
PowerSnap icon into the WbStartup drawer of your boot disk/partition.  And
that's all there is to it.  Specify options in the icon's tooltypes.  If you
do it this way you don't have to change your startup-sequence.


›1m3. CLI usage›0m
›1m============›0m

     Enter 'PowerSnap ?' for a CLI usage template:

     ›1mPowerSnap 1.1›0;32m © Nico François›0m
     Usage: PowerSnap [QUAL qual] [SLQUAL qual] [PASTEKEY char] [PRIORITY n]
                      [COLOR 1-3] [PAQUAL qual] [PREPEND str] [APPEND str]
                      [SNAPCHARS] [SNAPFRAME] [[NO]JOIN] [[NO]XEROX]
         or PowerSnap LIST
         or PowerSnap QUIT

     Explanation of the options:

     QUAL qual   : Set snap qualifier (qual, default: LALT).
                   This is the qualifier that must be down when you press
                   the left mouse button to start snapping.  This is also the
                   qualifier for inserting the snapped text.  There are two
                   ways to insert snapped text: using the pastekey or using
                   the right mouse button.
     SLQUAL qual : Set single line qualifier (qual, default: LALT+LSHIFT).
                   When this qualifier is down and you insert snapped text
                   everything will be put on one single line.  All whitespace
                   (spaces and newlines) between words will be changed to a
                   single space.  Very useful for inserting a lot of filenames
                   from a directory for example.
     PASTEKEY c  : Set pastekey (character, default: V).
                   This key is used to insert the snapped text.  Insertion
                   will follow when it is pressed with on of the three
                   possible qualifiers down (QUAL, SLQUAL, PAQUAL).
     PRIORITY n  : Set priority of inputhandler (dec, default: 55).
                   Priority of input handler (should always be > 50).
     SNAPCHARS   : Start with character snap (default).
     SNAPFRAME   : Start with frame snap.
                   PowerSnap has two snap modes: character and frame.  The
                   easiest to explain is frame snap, you just draw a rectangle
                   and everything inside it will be snapped.  Character snap
                   will interpret the screen as lines of text (like an editor)
                   and will snap accordingly.
     [NO]JOIN    : Join mode on/off (default: on).
                   Tells PowerSnap if it's ok to join two lines to a single
                   long line when the first line has a non blank character
                   as its last character.  This only works when you are using
                   character or word snap.  Default is JOIN.
     [NO]XEROX   : Xerox insert mode on/off (default: off).
                   When xerox mode is on snapped text will be inserted
                   immediately when you stop snapping.  Default is NOXEROX.
     COLOR 1-3   : Set color of select box (1-3, default: 1).
                   This sets the color of the complemented characters.
                   Try all three and see what you like best.
     PAQUAL qual : Set pre-/append qualifier (qual, default: LALT+CONTROL).
                   When using this qualifier to insert snapped text a string
                   will be prepended to each line and one will be appended.
     PREPEND str : Set prepend string (default: "> ").
                   Use this to set the string that will be prepended when you
                   paste with the PAQUAL down.  This string can be up to 15
                   characters long.  To enter a '"' in the string escape it
                   with a '*'.  E.g. 'PowerSnap PREPEND " *" "'.
     APPEND str  : Set append string (default: empty).
                   Use this to set the string that will be appended when you
                   paste with the PAQUAL down.  Can be up to 15 characters.

     Following qualifiers are recognized:

         LSHIFT          Left shift key
         RSHIFT          Right shift key
         CONTROL         Control key
         LALT            Left alt key
         RALT            Right alt key
         LCOMMAND        Left Amiga key
         RCOMMAND        Right Amiga key
         MIDBUTTON       Middle mouse button (if you have one :-)

     Or any combination of these (separate the qualifiers by a non-alpha
character like a '+', '-' or '|'), e.g. 'LALT+LSHIFT' or 'LALT-LSHIFT'.

     You may run PowerSnap again once it has been installed to change the
settings.  Enter 'PowerSnap LIST' for a list of current settings.
     'PowerSnap QUIT' will remove the handler from memory.

     Examples:

        o PowerSnap PREPEND "Type " APPEND " OPT N"

         When you paste some text 'Type ' will be inserted before each line
         and ' OPT N' after.  If you e.g. snap 'PowerSnap.c' and press
         LALT-CTRL-V the following will be inserted: 'Type PowerSnap.c OPT N'

        o PowerSnap QUAL LSHIFT+RSHIFT+CONTROL

         This sets the snap qualifier to both shift keys plus the control
         key.  This is a rather silly example because unless your name is
         Zaphod Beeblebrox or you are very good at doing things with your
         feet it is quite impossible to snap anything with this qualifier :^)

        o PowerSnap PASTEKEY i

         Sets the insert key to 'I' instead of 'V'.  So pressing LALT-I
         will feed the text in the clipboard to the keyboard.

NOTE: - You can toggle between character/frame snap once you have started
        snapping.  Just keep the left mouse pressed down while you click the
        right one.  Be careful, if you don't keep the left button pressed
        you will insert the text you have marked.
      - PowerSnap has the ability to do word oriented snapping.  To activate
        this double-click the left mouse button when you start snapping.  Note
        that word snapping forces character snapping and frame snapping is no
        longer possible.
      - Press the left mouse button while PowerSnap is inserting to abort.

     PowerSnap recognizes the following tooltypes (see CLI options for a more
complete explanation):

     QUAL=qual   : Set snap qualifier (qual, default: LALT).
     SLQUAL=qual : Set single line qualifier (qual, default: LALT+LSHIFT).
     PASTEKEY=c  : Set pastekey (character, default: V).
     PRIORITY=n  : Set priority of inputhandler (dec, default: 55).
     SNAPCHARS   : Start with character snap (default).
     SNAPFRAME   : Start with frame snap.
     COLOR=1-3   : Set color of select box (1-3, default: 1).
     JOIN        : Join mode on (default).
     NOJOIN      : Join mode off.
     XEROX       : Xerox insert mode on.
     NOXEROX     : Xerox insert mode off (default).
     PAQUAL=qual : Set pre-/append qualifier (qual, default: LALT+CONTROL).
     PREPEND=str : Set prepend string (default: "> ").
     APPEND=str  : Set append string (default: empty).
                   Do NOT put quotes around the pre-/append string.
     QUIET       : Don't open window informing PowerSnap has been installed
                   or removed.  Useful for people who wish to put PowerSnap
                   in their WbStartup drawer (Workbench 2.0 only).

     Select PowerSnap's icon and choose 'Information' from the 'Icons' menu
(Workbench 2.0) or 'Info' from the 'Workbench' menu (Workbench 1.3).  You can
now edit PowerSnap's tooltypes, check your manual for more information.
     Run PowerSnap twice to remove it from memory.

NOTE: - Workbench 1.2/1.3 users MUST always include an '=' in a tooltype.
        So instead of entering "XEROX" to switch on xerox insert mode, you
        must insert "XEROX=".  Workbench 2.0 no longer has this limitation.

     o Fully supports the clipboard.device.  You can use snapped text in all
       other programs that supports the clipboard.device.

     o Snaps all printable characters, from ' ' (32) to 'ÿ' (255).

     o Supports all keymaps.

     o Uses a relatively small handler that is about 7.4K long.  PowerSnap
       uses less than 12K of memory once it is installed (excluding memory
       used by the clipboard.device).

     o Recognizes all non-proportional fonts to up to 24 pixels wide and of
       any height.  Also recognizes scaled fonts (Workbench 2.0).

     o Recognizes plain, underlined, bold, inverse, bold underlined, inverse
       underlined, inverse bold and inverse bold underlined characters :-)

     o Works with fonts with kerning data (like the courier.font supplied
       with Workbench 2.0).

     o Will remember character positions in up to 8 windows.  Once you have
       snapped in a window the initial character position will be found
       immediately and you may also start snapping on spaces.

     o Joins long lines.

     o Pre-/appends strings and has a neat single-line insert mode :-)

     o Supports a middle mouse button if one exists.  Using the middle button
       as qualifier gives the possibility to snap/paste without touching the
       keyboard!

     o Inputhandler is written in assembly for lowest possible overhead.

     o AmigaDOS Release 2 compatible (Kickstart & Workbench 2.0).


                                                 As always, enjoy !


                              PROGRAM HISTORY:

******************************************************************************
VERSION 1.0

     First release.

******************************************************************************
VERSION 1.1

     Fixed bug in reading from clipboard.  Strange things could happen if the
       clipboard did not contain text. Unknown clips are properly ignored now.
     Incompatibility with 'ConClip' (Workbench 2.0, V37) resolved.
     Default COLOR changed to 1.
     Version string embedded for Workbench 2.0 'Version' command.
     To put the record straight:  PowerSnap is not a modified version of
       Snap (by Mikael Karlsson).  It is a completely different program
       that does most of the things Snap does.  A lot of the features and
       ideas in PowerSnap were influenced by (read stolen from :-) Snap
       though.  I just thought I'd mention this because some German magazine
       almost convicted me for plagiarism, oh boy :^D
     The Amiga would hang if you tried to snap something just when a window
       was about to close.  Now all the Intuition functions that open, close
       or modify windows are patched so they will wait until snapping has
       finished.  If you are running Kickstart 2.0, the new Intuition
       functions are also patched.  This should fix all deadlocks.
     New tooltype 'QUIET' added for startup from Workbench without window.
     Tested with Enforcer and Mungwall debugging tools.
