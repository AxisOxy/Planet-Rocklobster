1. An introduction
==================

     This program was written out of utter frustration (as many good programs
are :-)  Commodore has decided to change the colors of the new Workbench 2.0
compared to 1.3.  Black and white are reversed!  So what's the problem you may
ask ?  Well, icon images with black and white swapped look fairly ugly!

     I know of two other programs that allow you to recolor the icons so they
look ok again, but neither of these programs features a Workbench interface!
Quite extraordinary if you ask me, a program that helps to make your Workbench
look nicer, but doesn't support it ?!?

     So there you have it, that's why you are now reading the documentation of
RemapInfo, the icon color remapper with an easy to use Workbench interface.

     RemapInfo is not just useful to Workbench 2.0 users, but also to people
who want to use icons designed for 2.0 on Workbench 1.3.  There are also many
people who have changed their Workbench 1.3 colors completely and it is very
possible that by using this program they may discover that they can enhance
their Workbench look significantly.

     RemapInfo is compatible with and supports Kickstart & Workbench 2.0.


2. Usage 
========

     RemapInfo can be used in several different ways.

- First of all via the CLI:

     If you enter 'RemapInfo ?' you will get a short usage message printed
to the console.  You use RemapInfo like this:

     RemapInfo [<file|dir>...]

     So simply give one or more filenames of icons you want to recolor as
arguments to RemapInfo.  There is no need to include the '.info'.

     Example:   'RemapInfo SYS:System SYS:Utilities/Clock.info'

     If you enter RemapInfo without arguments and you have arp.library or
asl.library installed in Libs: you will be presented with a file requester.

- Via the WorkBench:

     This is definately the easiest way to use RemapInfo, the CLI interface
was only implemented for completeness.

     There are two ways ways of using RemapInfo via the workbench:  you can
simply double-click the RemapInfo icon and select a filename using the Arp
or Asl file requester or, and this is certainly the easiest way: you can
single click the RemapInfo icon and then extend-select one or more other
icons (use shift click, double-clicking the last one).  RemapInfo will then
proceed and recolor each of the icons you selected.

     If your Amiga has Kickstart 2.0 in ROM there is an even easier way to use
RemapInfo:  When you double-click RemapInfo you will NOT be presented with a
file requester but with an additional icon in the Workbench window.  If you
now drop some other icons on this icon these will be recolored.  Couldn't be
easier now, could it :-)  Double-clicking the icon brings up a requester
asking you if you want to quit RemapInfo.


                           As always, I hope you find this program useful!


                              PROGRAM HISTORY:

*****************************************************************************
VERSION 1.0

     First release.

*****************************************************************************
VERSION 1.1

     No longer opens anoying window when started from Workbench (unless there
       are errors of course).
     If you double-click the RemapInfo_1.1 icon RemapInfo will ask you if you
       want to quit or keep running.
     RemapInfo now remaps ALL icons, also those with more than 4 colors!
