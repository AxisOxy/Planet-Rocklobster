1. An introduction
==================

   PPShow was written to complement one of my other utilities, PowerPacker
(a command and data cruncher).  It is used to show normal IFF ILBM files or
ILBM files crunched with PowerPacker.  The decrunching is done automatically
so the user doesn't have to know if a file is crunched or not.

   PPShow uses 'powerpacker.library' and 'reqtools.library', so make sure
these are present in your Libs: directory.  Double-click 'Install_libs' for
an automatic installation.

     If you haven't got PowerPacker you are of course missing one of the main
features of this program.  PowerPacker is available as shareware (up to
version 2.3b) or as a commercial program (version 4.0a).  The commercial
version offers several enhancements like 40 to 50 times faster crunching,
better crunching, overlay support and an ARexx port.


2. Usage
========

   PPShow can be used in several different ways.

- First of all via the CLI:

   If you enter 'PPShow ?' you will get a standard AmigaDOS usage template,
enter 'PPShow ??' for more information.  You use PPShow like this:

   PPShow {<file|dir>} [LO] [HI] [SHI] [PROD] [L=LACE] [NL=NOLACE] [HAM]
                       [TIME s] [NOCYCLE] [NO=NOOVERSCAN] [A2024 [15Hz]]
                       [PAL] [NTSC] [VGA] [LOOP]

   The program will by default load the specified ILBM file and display it.
If the file was crunched using PowerPacker 2.0 or higher PPShow will first
decrunch it for you.  If the file was encrypted you will be prompted for the
password.  You may specify more than one file on the command line and you may
even use wildcards, PPShow will show all files one at a time, double buffering
the display.

   If you enter PPShow without options, you will be presented with a
filerequester.  Entering PPShow with a directory instead of a file as an
argument will also get you a requester, but it will be positioned in the
directory you specified.

   There are several command line options:

     LO         : Force screen to open in LORES        mode.
     HI         :   ''    ''    ''   ''   HIRES         ''
     SHI        :   ''    ''    ''   ''   SUPERHIRES    ''
     PROD       :   ''    ''    ''   ''   PRODUCTIVITY  ''
     LACE       : Force interlace on.
     NOLACE     : Force interlace off.
     HAM        : This switch is used to select HAM mode when no CAMG chunk
                  is found.  If you don't specify this switch PPShow will
                  assume a 6 plane screen is extra-halfbrite. Note that this
                  switch does not force HAM mode, it merely instruct PPShow
                  to use HAM mode in case of doubt.
     TIME s     : Display pictures for 's' seconds.
     NOCYCLE    : Do not start cycling automatically.
     NOOVERSCAN : Disable overscan.
     LOOP       : Display all pictures in a loop, press CTRL-D to abort.
     PAL        : Use 'pal.monitor'.
     NTSC       : Use 'ntsc.monitor'.
     VGA        : Use 'multiscan.monitor'. Please note that when using VGA,
                  LO puts the screen in EXTRALORES, HI in LORES and SHI in
                  PRODUCTIVITY (same as PROD).
     A2024      : Use 'a2024.monitor'.
     15Hz       : Put A2024 monitor into 15Hz, rather than 10Hz.

   PPShow can be made resident so it doesn't have to be loaded every time
you use it, use the c: Resident command for this.  You can't make PPShow
resident when it is crunched!!  The file is supplied as an uncrunched command
file with the pure bit set.  PPShow is reentrant as well, so you can run it
from several CLI's at the same time.  (Not that this is very useful, but it's
possible :-)

   Examples:

    o PPShow dh0:pics/HAMpicWithoutCAMG.pic HAM

    o PPShow dir/#?.pic TIME 5 LOOP

       Show all files in directory 'dir' with a '.pic' suffix for 5 seconds
       and loop until user presses CTRL-D.

    o PPShow PICS:~(#?.info) NOOVERSCAN

       Show all files on 'PICS:' NOT ending in '.info'. Disable overscan.


- Via the WorkBench:

   There are three different ways of using PPShow via the workbench: you
can set the default tool of the (crunched) ILBM file to 'PPShow', you can
single click the PPShow icon and then extend-select one or more picture icons
(use shift click, double-clicking the last one) or you can double-click the
PPShow icon and specify a filename using the filerequester.
   You set the default tool by single clicking the icon of the picture and
selecting 'Information' from the 'Icons' menu.  You will get a window with
several gadgets in it, click in the string gadget where it says 'Default tool'
and enter ':ppshow'.  PPShow should be in the root directory of your disk for
this to work, if e.g.  it's in the system directory you should enter
':system/ppshow'.  Last of all select the 'Save' gadget.

   Following tooltypes are recognized by PPShow (in the pictures' icon, not
PPShow's icon):

     HAM        : See CLI option.
     TIME=s     : Display picture for 's' seconds.
     NOCYCLE    : Do not start cycling automatically.
     NOOVERSCAN : Disable overscan.


NOTE: - Follow these steps to make a simple slideshow that runs by double-
        clicking an icon:  Make a script file containing something like the
        following line: 'PPShow #?.pic TIME 10 LOOP'.  Set this script's
        default tool to 'c:IconX' and enter 'WINDOW=CON://///AUTO' in its
        tooltypes.  Put the script in a directory containing pictures (all
        ending in '.pic'!).  If you now double-click this scripts icon the
        slideshow will start, press ESC or CTRL-D to end.
      - PPShow will add '.pp' to the filename when the file wasn't found.
        This is very useful in the Workbench enviroment: you can make an
        icon for 'house.pic' but name the file 'house.pic.pp'.  Now the
        WorkBench will show an icon with 'house.pic' as name, but if you
        doubleclick it 'house.pic.pp' will be displayed. (As long as there
        is no 'house.pic' file in the directory!)
      - Drag as many monitor icons to the WbStartup drawer as your monitor
        allows.  For example: if you have a multiscan monitor drag pal, ntsc
        and multiscan.monitor to your WbStartup drawer.  If you do this you
        will have maximum ease of use of PPShow.


3. Features
===========

   - Abort PPShow by pressing 'Q', CTRL-C or the right mouse button.  Press
     CTRL-D to abort everything and to break a script.  The screen can be
     dragged by pressing LEFT-AMIGA, holding down the left mouse button and
     moving the mouse (you may have to press something else than LEFT-AMIGA,
     depending on your 'IControl' preferences settings).

   - PPShow offers full overscan and monitor support: PAL, NTSC, VGA, A2024.

   - PPShow can be used as a simple slideshow tool.  It supports wildcards
     to simplify this.

   - Deluxe Paint color cycling is supported, press <TAB> to (de)activate.
     Up to 8 cycles are supported (DPaint III currently only supports 6).

   - The pesky little mouse will be removed while displaying.  Press 'M' to
     toggle the mouse pointer on/off.

   - Press 'L' to load another picture, you will be presented with the
     filerequester.


4. Note on crunching
====================

   A lot of IFF ILBM files are already crunched with the standard ByteRun1
compression.  PowerPacker will crunch these files even further (most of the
time) but will not crunch them as well as uncrunched ILBM files.  So save IFF
files uncrunched (if you can, e.g. with PixMate) before crunching them, this
way you will get the best crunching results.


                        As always, I hope you find this program useful!


                              PROGRAM HISTORY:

*****************************************************************************
VERSION 1.0

     First release.

*****************************************************************************
VERSION 1.1

     Decrunching is about 40% faster (accidently used slow decruncher in 1.0)
     Screen now pops to front when picture is ready to be viewed, not before.
     Filerequester used when arp.library is available.
     'L' command added to load other pictures without restarting PPShow.

*****************************************************************************
VERSION 1.1a

     The Guru isn't with me lately, after using a slow decruncher in 1.0
       by accident I now used a fast but faulty decruncher in 1.1. It
       sometimes didn't decrunch correctly, this has now been fixed. The
       decruncher is still 40% faster than the 1.0 one. (and it's 2 bytes
       shorter :^D )

*****************************************************************************
VERSION 1.2

     Rewrote cycling routine in assembly, so less overhead when cycling.
     Uses the all new powerpacker.library => shorter code.
     Starting PPShow from the CLI with a directory as an argument now puts
       up the requester positioned in that directory. Extremely useful once
       you get used to this :^)
     If you are running Workbench 2.0 PPShow will use the asl.library
       instead of the arp.library (for the filerequester).
     Fixed serious bug: memory wasn't freed when an IFF error occured.
     No longer tries to display small brushes (intuition doesn't like very
       small screens :( )

*****************************************************************************
VERSION 2.0

     PPShow requires Kickstart 2.0 to run.  Sorry to all the 1.2 and 1.3
       users, just consider this program as another reason to upgrade :-)

     Filerequester from arp.library is no longer supported.
     PPShow now uses reqtools.library (also by moi) for its requesters.
       Among other things this means a much better filerequester than
       before (with a buffer).  Asl is no longer used, sorry Commodore :-)
     Printing of screen removed, has anybody ever used this ? :-)
     Improved command line format, follows AmigaDOS standard. (old option
       '-h' is no longer supported!).
     IFF decrunching rewritten in assembly: much faster and shorter.
     Shows pictures saved in DPaint with stencil on. In other words: supports
       IFF picture masking.
     No longer quits when you press any key, you have to press 'Q', CTRL-C,
       or right mouse button; CTRL-D aborts PPShow and breaks scripts.
     Color cycling is now automatically switched on (except for brushes).
     Mouse pointer visibility can be toggled.
     Possibility to automatically stop displaying after a specified number
       of seconds.
     Many new command line options: change display resolution, switch off
       overscan, disable auto-cycling, etc.
     Several options may be set using Workbench tooltypes.
     From Workbench, if you single-click PPShow and shift double-click a
       drawer icon, PPShow will open up the filerequester in that drawer.
     If you use 'PPShow <file>' or extend-select <file> from Workbench and
       you invoke the filerequester, it will be positioned in the directory
       <file> is in.
     The filerequester will appear on the picture screen if possible.
     Canceling the filerequester no longer quits PPShow.
     The filerequester will filter out the .info files.
     Can be used as a simple slideshow program: supports wildcards and
       multiple files on command line, also possible to loop the slideshow.
       Picture switching is double buffered.  Multiple extended selection
       from Workbench is also supported.
     Overscan now done using Kickstart 2.0 display clips.
     Supports all new ECS display modes (ECS Denise only) and all monitors.
     Will switch to PAL or NTSC monitor automatically (ECS Agnus only).
     PPShow will now show very large screens without problem, AUTOSCROLL is
       switched on so the screen automatically scrolls when you move the
       mouse pointer off the edge.
     Screen no longer has an invisible dragbar.  Use meta-dragging (left
       Amiga key + mouse) to drag the screen.
     Directories are expanded to their full pathnames on startup.
     PPShow now returns a returncode of 20 in case of an error or if ended
       by CTRL-D.
     Error reporting improved: when started from CLI, errors are printed
       on the console; when started from Workbench, a requester is used.
     All these great new features and PPShow grew only about 1K in size :-)
