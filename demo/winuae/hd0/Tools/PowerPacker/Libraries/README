   To save disk space the library packages in the pplib and
   reqtoolslib directory are archived with LhArc.

   You will need LhArc to decompress these archives.  LhArc is a
   freely distributable program and can be found on Fish disk 312.

   The library packages include full documentation to powerpacker.library
   and reqtools.library with autodocs and include files.
